# Charge_Pump_NMOS
Design of a Charge pump with NMOS.
A charge pump circuit in VLSI (Very Large ScaleIntegration) is a type of DC-DC converter that efficiently generates higher or lower voltage levels from a given input voltage
without the need for inductors. It operates by transferring charge between capacitors through switches, allowing for a compact and efficient design. Compared to traditional buck and boost
converters, charge pumps offer advantages such as reduced size and cost since they do not require bulky inductors. They also have lower electromagnetic interference (EMI), making them
suitable for integrated circuit designs where space and noise are critical considerations. Additionally, charge pumps can achieve
high efficiency at low power levels, which is beneficial in battery operated devices. 

NMOS

An NMOS (N-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistor is a type of field-effect transistor (FET) that uses electrons as the charge carriers. It consists of a source, drain, and gate terminal, with the current flowing between the source and drain when a voltage is applied to the gate

Charge Pump

A charge pump is a circuit that converts a low voltage toa higher voltage by transferring charge through capacitors.It works by alternately charging and discharging capacitors using switches, creating a step-up effect that boosts the output voltage. This technique is commonly used in devices requiring higher voltages than their power supply can provide.

Charge pumps are the best solutions if we want to avoid large inductors and shorten the space though it may have some trade offs.
