# Experience of the Hackathon

There are 2 Readme file 

a) **A_Charge_pump_Research.md** which shares you my research work 
<br/>b) **Charge_pump_Implementation.md** which shares you my implementation work.

Finally there was an issue with the creation of the Ngspice to Kicad conversion of the final Ip (Black_box) Circuit hence have the waveform of the NMOS circuit . Couldn't get any resolution in time . The software was crashing in my system . 
Please I would implore you to ignore this software issue and rate my work irrespective of that.

Thank you , it was a nice experience to be a part of the Hackathon.
